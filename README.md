 About Project 3:
  Project 3 is a contract tracking app that manages your partners and the contracts that each User Profile has. Think:: This idea is essentially a ROllADEX but instead of business cards, the program stores contracts and partners. This program keeps and manages the times between active contracts using MomentJS. Also the app uses the DocuSign API to import and share the users signature.
